# Idea-repo
This repository is for any real life idea I think about. I'd be updating here and I'm sure one of them is surely going to be the next big thing.
I'd make it a public repo as soon as i start updating it, I just need to properly describe the problem statements.
Feel free, to message, email or reach out to me for collaboration and let's build the next big thing!

We're software engineers, we can build anything!


# 1. A way to secure or track mobile phones when stolen

Proposed Idea
Have a web app where each users can come and register their phones using IMEI.
So we have a cross referencing and can flag it if two different users are trying to sign up using the same IMEI.



## 2. A web or mobile app that tells if you have light in your area in realtime.
This is spcifically for Nigerians cause sadly we're yet to have 24/7 electricity.


# 3. Interview Web App
It's going to be like a social media site where users can connect together according to their respective career fields
All they are coming to do here would just be interview online call
Users can practise their interview skills here
And we can make it freelance so demand can meet supply



# 4 Attendance Application that can only work on the sch's wifi network

Many users stab classes and this is getting higher in this digital day and age. Most students tell their peers to help sign for them while absent and this is very wrong.
This attendace application will take the students attendance twice 10 minutes before class and after class.
They just need to signin and tick the clickbox
The webapp would work on the sch's local wifi and would not need the use of data


# 5 Social Campaign for Road Safety
Problem Statement
Most Nigerians use their seatbelts due to the fear of Lastma and authorities. Once that is not there they don't.
This orientation is very wrong and needs to change.
Social awareness needs to be carried out.

Step 1 - Create a google form
Questions - when do you use your seat belt, immediately you get in, when you see a police or lastma
When do you take it off, after passing a checkpoint, when you get to your destination, when you feel uncomfortable.

Checked the fine for not using your beltin Lagos state.
20k first time
30k second or subsequent times
or 6 months
But this isn't the problem 
we should make them se that its for our own safety and not the 20k fine

Possible solutions 
MASSIVE AWARENESS
From the roadside hawker, down to the top executive
Videos showing this impact should be placed on electric billboards and put in strategic places
Fliers should be printed and shared out
A 1 week online course on road safety should be taken by defaulters(Course would be taught by professionals and also youtube videos)


* # 6 An app or extension that can blur and mute out sex scenes or nude contents in movies.*








##Felt like I'd never write these out
##I'd come back later to write their problem statements and properly break these down.
