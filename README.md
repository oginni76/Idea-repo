# Idea-repo
This repository is for any real life idea I think about. I'd be updating here and I'm sure one of them is surely going to be the next big thing.
I'd make it a public repo as soon as i start updating it, I just need to properly describe the problem statements.
Feel free, to message, email or reach out to me for collaboration and let's build the next big thing!

We're software engineers, we can build anything!
